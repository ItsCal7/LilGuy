Final Project for Game Design 
This was created by Myself, Colette Campbell, and Owen Campbell (No relation)
It is made to run in Quest, a software designed for Text Adventures. 
Colette created the pixel art for the game as well as much of the writing of the story.
I worked on programming and assisted in writing.
Owen worked on puzzle design and programming.
